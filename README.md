Folder Structure Explanation

1. config/
   This folder is used for configuration files, such as database connections and other environment-specific settings.

db.js: This file contains the logic to connect to the MongoDB database. By isolating the database connection logic, we can easily modify or extend it without touching other parts of the application.

2.  controllers/
    Controllers handle the business logic of the application. They interact with models to retrieve or update data and send responses back to the client.

todoController.js: Contains the logic for handling to-do-related operations, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting to-dos.

userController.js: Contains the logic for handling user-related operations, such as creating a user, logging in, updating user information, and deleting users.

3.  models/

Models represent the data structure and define how data is stored and retrieved from the database.

Todo.js: Defines the schema and model for to-do items.

User.js: Defines the schema and model for users.

4.  routes/

Routes define the endpoints for the API and map them to the corresponding controller functions.

todoRoutes.js: Defines the routes for to-do operations and maps them to functions in todoController.js.

userRoutes.js: Defines the routes for user operations and maps them to functions in userController.js.

5.  utils/

Utility functions and helper methods that are used throughout the application.

hashPassword.js: (Optional) Contains a utility function for hashing passwords. This can be reused wherever password hashing is needed.

6. .env
   A file that contains environment variables. These variables can be different for development, testing, and production environments and are not included in version control for security reasons.

7. server.js
   The main entry point of the application. It sets up the Express server, connects to the database, and defines the middleware and routes.
